This repository contains scripts to analyse orbital flight paths for Earth and 2024 asteroid yr4. The main code is run from main.py, and supplementary diagrams are found in other scripts.

The code extensively looks into, orbits, numerical integration, mapping flight paths, rotation matricies to and from ECI and perifocal frames, as well as impulses in radial, transverse and normal directions.
